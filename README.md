# overview_activity
simple Python script using the GitHub API and the matplotlib library to generate a pie chart showing the primary language distribution of the repositories you contributed to in the current year.  

Make sure to replace `'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME'` and `'YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN'` with your actual GitHub username and token.  
```python
github_username = 'YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME'
github_token = 'YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN'
```

This script fetches the list of repositories you contributed to in the current year and generates a pie chart based on the primary language of those repositories using matplotlib. You can install matplotlib using:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
